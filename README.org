Misc Utilities
*  Miscellaneous utilities for elisp.
   This is a small but growing collection of some tools I have created for my
   own amusment or use.  It is not in any way recommended for general use and
   any problems you experiance are your own responsibility.

** tail-call.el
   Well, so this was created in one day, because it seemed like a good idea at
   the time.  It is still in great need of work, but it establishes a drop in
   replacement for defun that optmizes tail-recursion in lexical environments,
   and establishes a framework for extending to further optimizable forms.

   Now optimizes all tail calls.

* eai-tools.el
  A small collection of elisp snippets from my .emacs, I use these, but have not
  yet consolidated, documented or placed into cohesive libraries.
